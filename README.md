## STREAMLINE - SmarT Reduction and Emulation Applying Machine Learning In Nuclear Environments

This project is a website for the scientific collaboration STREAMLINE, created using React.

## High-Level Overview

STREAMLINE (SmarT Reduction and Emulation Applying Machine Learning In Nuclear Environments) is a cutting-edge scientific collaboration aimed at revolutionizing the field of nuclear physics through the application of machine learning (ML) techniques. Our mission is to advance theoretical and computational research on the nuclear many-body problem, leveraging the power of ML to achieve unprecedented levels of predictive accuracy and understanding.

### Key Objectives

- Develop fast and accurate emulators for large-scale nuclear physics computations.
- Implement smart model extrapolation techniques to enhance predictive power.
- Learn correlations in wave functions and operators to improve theoretical models.
- Predict nuclear dynamics, including nuclear fission and heavy-ion fusion.
- Foster an AI-capable workforce through extensive educational and training programs.
- Promote Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging within the nuclear physics community.

### Our Team

Our collaboration brings together leading researchers in the fields of machine learning and theoretical nuclear physics. Our team is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge and making a lasting impact on the field of nuclear physics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ascsn/streamline-site.git
   cd streamline-site
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server, run:
```bash
npm start
```

This will start the React application and open it in your default web browser. The application will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source code.

### Building the Application

To build the application for production, run:
```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized and minified build of the application in the `build` directory.

### Testing the Application

To run the tests, run:
```bash
npm test
```

This will execute the test suite and display the results in the console.

## Project Structure
