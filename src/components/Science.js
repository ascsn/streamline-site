      <h2>Scientific Objectives</h2>
      <p>STREAMLINE (SmarT Reduction and Emulation Applying Machine Learning In Nuclear Environments) is a cutting-edge scientific collaboration aimed at revolutionizing the field of nuclear physics through the application of machine learning (ML) techniques. Our mission is to advance theoretical and computational research on the nuclear many-body problem, leveraging the power of ML to achieve unprecedented levels of predictive accuracy and understanding.</p>
      <p>Our key objectives include developing fast and accurate emulators for large-scale nuclear physics computations, implementing smart model extrapolation techniques to enhance predictive power, learning correlations in wave functions and operators to improve theoretical models, and predicting nuclear dynamics, including nuclear fission and heavy-ion fusion.</p>
      <p>We are committed to fostering an AI-capable workforce through extensive educational and training programs within the nuclear physics community. Our collaboration aims to serve as a pilot model that builds the intellectual infrastructure and workforce, thereby leveraging future funding initiatives in AI/ML by the DOE Office of Nuclear Physics.</p>
